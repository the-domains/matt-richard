# Mini-Sun

I made Mini-Sun as a prototype/maquette for a larger work created for [Jason Krugman Studios][0]. The CAD process was carried out in Adobe Illustrator. The design file was used to layout and order the LEDs as well as provide the dimensions for a CNC milled LED mounting plate. The STL was created in Rhinoceros and the tool path was created in MeshCam. I used leftover LPD8806 addressable LED strips wired in a serpentine pattern being controlled by a Teensy 3.1\. The LEDs were programmed using the [FastLED library][1] in the Arduino IDE.
